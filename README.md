Dialogue Conventions

When changing the text of what the King is saying, please note the below

  - Write no less than one line and no more than two lines when writing the King's dialogue
  
  - Consider how long your sentences are when creating dialogue or it will not fit in the dialogue box
  
  - Use the grave accent (`) followed by a letter to change the colour of the King's speech
    - `r for red
    - `g for green
    - `b for blue
    - `y for yellow
    - `m for magenta
    - `c for cyan
    - `w for white
    - Be mindful that you will need to reset the colour back to white when you are finished using a different colour

  - Use - followed by a number (no less than 0 and no more than 99) to get the king to WIDEN HIS EYES for a number of letters, but can only be an estimate. Feel free to experiment
  
  - DON'T USE - FOR ANYTHING ELSE OR YOU'LL BREAK IT!
